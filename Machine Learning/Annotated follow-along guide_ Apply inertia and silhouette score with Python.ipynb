It's important to scale because K-means doesn't know what your unit label is for each variable. Suppose you had data for penguins, and height were measured in meters and weight were measured in grams. Without scaling, significant differences in height would be represented as small numbers, while minor differences in weight would be represented as much larger numbers.\n",

There are a number of scaling techniques available, including `StandardScaler`, `MinMaxScaler`, `Normalizer`, and others, each scaling the data in a particular way. There's no hard rule for determining which method will work best, but with K-means models, using any scaler will almost always result in better results than not scaling at all. \n",

    "## Why is this useful?\n",
    "\n",
    "One situation for which being able to assign new points to clusters is useful is when you have a deployed model that was trained on huge amounts of data, and it must process new data as it comes in on a case-by-case basis. For example, suppose you have a marketing program that sends out different promotional emails to different customers, depending on their engagement patterns with your brand. When you get a new customer, you could use a clustering model to assign them to an appropriate marketing campaign, so they see promotions that are most appropriate for them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, both the cluster predictions and the distance measurements to centroids can be used as new features in supervised learning models. You can take the training data of a supervised learning problem and cluster it, then use either the cluster assignments or the distance matrices as engineered predictive features to improve the predictive power of a supervised learning model.
